# Netflix-Data-Analysis 
This repository contains a Tableau dashboard that visualizes data on movies and TV shows available on the Netflix website. The dashboard provides an interactive view of the data, allowing users to explore the data and gain insights into the types of content available on Netflix.

The dashboard includes several visualizations, including:
Total Movies and TV Shows by Year: A line chart that shows the total number of movies and TV shows available on Netflix by year of release.
Top 10 Genres: A bar chart that shows the top 10 genres of movies and TV shows available on Netflix.
Movies and TV Shows Distribution: A stacked bar chart that shows the distribution of movies and TV shows available on Netflix by type (movie or TV show) and by country of release.
The dashboard is built using Tableau Public, a free platform for creating and sharing data visualizations. The Netflix dataset is included in the repository, along with a Tableau workbook file (.twbx) that contains the dashboard.
